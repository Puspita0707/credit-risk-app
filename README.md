# Credit Risk Survival Analysis & Predictive Modeling

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](
credit-risk-app-mhzzflgzyb3pbc9gdka2ze.streamlit.app)
An end-to-end data science project that predicts not just *if* a loan will default, but *when*, using survival analysis. The final model is deployed as an interactive web application with Streamlit for real-time risk assessment.

## üìã Project Overview

This project addresses a key challenge in the financial sector: understanding the dynamics of credit risk over time. While traditional classification models predict the probability of default, this project implements a **Cox Proportional Hazards survival model** to forecast the timing of default. This provides a more nuanced view of risk, enabling better financial planning and proactive risk management.

The analysis is based on a large-scale dataset from LendingClub, and the final, validated model is deployed as a user-friendly web application for real-time risk assessment of new loan applicants.
